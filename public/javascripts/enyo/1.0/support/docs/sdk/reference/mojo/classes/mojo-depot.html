      Depot is an API that allows you to store JavaScript objects in a database. Today it is implemented as a framework wrapper around HTML5 active record access; but this could change in the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can create a new Depot like this:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>var db = new Mojo.Depot(options, onSuccess, onFailure);
</code>
</pre>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      where <code>options</code> is an object whose properties contain a number of options for opening or creating a Depot.
    </p>
    <blockquote>

replace         Boolean                         ?           ?           A truthy value for replace will cause any existing data for this

    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <pre>
<code>{Function} onSuccess  Callback function that is called if the depot is successfully opened or created.
{Function} onFailure  Callback function that is called with an error string if an error occurs.

The following error codes may be returned to onFailure:
Code  Situation
0     The transaction failed for reasons unrelated to the database itself and not covered by any other error code.
1     The statement failed for database reasons not covered by any other error code.
2     The statement failed because the expected version of the database didn't match the actual database version.
3     The statement failed because the data returned from the database was too large.
      The SQL &quot;LIMIT&quot; modifier might be useful to reduce the size of the result set.
4     The statement failed because there was not enough remaining storage space,
      or the storage quota was reached and the user declined to give more space to the database.
5     The statement failed because the transaction's first statement was a read-only statement,
      and a subsequent statement in the same transaction tried to modify the database, but the
      transaction failed to obtain a write lock before another transaction obtained a write lock
      and changed a part of the database that the former transaction was depending upon.
6     An INSERT, UPDATE, or REPLACE statement failed due to a constraint failure.
      For example, because a row was being inserted and the value given for the primary key column
      duplicated the value of an existing row.
