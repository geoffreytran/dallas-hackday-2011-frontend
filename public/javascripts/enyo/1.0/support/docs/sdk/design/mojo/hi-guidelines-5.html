      Working on the Details
    </h3>
    <p>
      Now that you've got a pretty good idea about what you need to include in the workflow and how much space you have to work with, you should take a moment to consider the following things:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>How many scenes do you really need?</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>What buttons should you display at the bottom of each scene, and which ones should you put in the Application menu?</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>When should a user action display the result in the current view vs. a new card?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When your application launches, it's launched in a card, and for the most part you should display all of your content there. If certain tasks or actions in your app would work better or more conveniently if they were able to work in a new card, you should open one. We'll discuss this further in the Email app example.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>What should happen when the user performs the &quot;back&quot; gesture on the gesture strip?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The &quot;back&quot; gesture is a &quot;half swipe&quot; in the gesture area, performed over the Center button. It's what user will do to navigate from the current scene to the previous scene. Users will learn how to do it in the tutorial they see when they use their device for the first time, and every application will make use of it.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are all very important questions, and are exactly the kind that affect how many scenes you need to design and develop, and how navigation works in your application. The team that wrote the Email application had to think about all these things, too. Let's look at a portion of their application to see how they did it:
    </p>
    <p>
      When the Email app launches, it opens a <strong>card</strong> that displays the <strong>Overview</strong> scene. Let's take a moment to get an understanding of how <strong>navigation</strong> works within the application.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          When Email launches, a new card is opened and the <strong>Overview</strong> scene appears. It displays a list of the Email Accounts the user has configured the app to display.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The user taps an Inbox. The <strong>List of Emails</strong> scene is opened (in the same card), displaying the list of email messages in that Inbox.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The user taps a message. The <strong>Read Message</strong> scene opens (in the same card).
        </p>
        <p>
          If the user performed the Back Gesture now, they'd return to the <strong>List of Emails</strong> scene. Another Back Gesture would lead back to the <strong>Overview</strong> scene. Because each scene was opened in the same card, the Back Gesture navigates to the previous scene within that card. But let's not worry about that right now. Let's assume the user tapped the &quot;Reply&quot; button instead.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The user taps the &quot;<strong>Reply</strong>&quot; button at the bottom of the <strong>Read Message</strong> scene. A <strong>new card</strong> is opened, where the user can reply to the message.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <strong>Reply</strong> scene is actually the <strong>Compose</strong> scene, with the appropriate content filled in. And because Compose, Reply, Reply All and Forward require the same functionality, it's possible to use the same scene for each action.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    </p>
    <h4 id="specify-buttons-and-menu-commands">
      Specify Buttons and Menu Commands
    </h4>
    <p>
      Each scene should have its own set of <strong>command buttons</strong> (represented as verbs in the diagram) and special commands in the <strong>Application Menu</strong> (represented in the white boxes near each scene). Sketch these out when working through your initial navigation flow. It will help you determine how many scenes you need, which actions are needed in each and how/when you can re-use a scene for a common purpose.
    </p>
    <h4 id="open-new-cards-only-when-needed">
      Open New Cards Only When Needed
    </h4>
    <p>
      In the example above, the Email team chose to open a new card when the user wants to compose a new message, reply to one or forward one. You might be wondering why they chose to do that. Here's why they did it:
    </p>
    <p>
      There are times when a user starts a task (like composing an email) and then realizes there's something they need to do before they can finish it. They might need to check information in a different email before writing their reply, or open the Web application and look for a URL they want to copy and paste into the message they're composing. This is exactly why we have the concept of &quot;cards&quot; in the webOS platform. So application designers and developers can support the user's workflow when they have needs like this. In a case like this, opening a new card is the right thing to do because it allows the user to break away from their task for a moment without losing any of their work (as can be the case in applications on other mobile OS platforms). When designing your scenes and your workflow, think about whether users might need to have a certain scene displayed in a new card. If there are good reasons to do so, do it. However, launch new cards only when necessary. When your app launches extra cards, it complicates the user experience because it adds to the set of cards displayed when the user presses the Center button. Each card also requires additional device resources. The guideline is &quot;if there's a good reason to open a card and it purposefully supports the user's workflow, open one. Otherwise, open new scenes in the current card.&quot;
    </p>
    <p>
      In many cases, applications can run perfectly in a <strong>single card</strong>. The Calendar app is a good example. Every action a user performs opens a scene in the same card, and the Back Gesture always returns them to the scene they had seen before. There's very little workflow-advantage to opening a new card in the Calendar app. The team that designed the Calendar app considered cases where there was <em>some</em> value in opening a new card, but decided against it because the value was not greater than the cost of the system resources required and the complexity added to the overall user experience. For those reasons, they decided that the Calendar app would open each new scene in the same card.
    </p>
    <h4 id="use-animations-effects-consistently">
      Use Animations Effects Consistently
    </h4>
    <p>
      The applications that ship on webOS devices use animation effects when transitioning from scene-to-scene and performing other actions. Here's how to use animations properly in your application:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Moving within the application's hierarchy of scenes</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          When moving down in the hierarchy, use the <strong>Zoom In</strong> effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          When moving back up the hierarchy, use the <strong>Zoom Out</strong> effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          When using the Back gesture, use the <strong>Zoom Out</strong> effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Launch the Email app. Tap one account, then one message item, then read the message -- the application uses the <strong>Zoom In</strong> effect in each case. The Back gesture uses the <strong>Zoom Out</strong> effect when the gesture is performed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Moving to a similar level in the hierarchy</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the <strong>Cross-Fade</strong> effect.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Launch the Phone application. Tap the Calls button (lower right hand corner). Tap All Calls, then Missed Calls. Both scenes exist at the same level in the application hierarchy and use the <strong>Cross-Fade</strong> effect.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Launching another application from yours</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Example:</strong> Launch the Web app, tap a mailto link. This opens the Email application. This opens a new card and uses the <strong>New Card</strong> animation.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="figure-out-when-you-should-save-data">
      Figure Out When You Should Save Data
    </h4>
    <p>
      It is your app's responsibility to determine when to save changes that users make to their data. Whenever possible, you should save changes automatically. This simplifies the user experience in several ways: it removes the need for a &quot;save&quot; button in your application, and frees the user from ever having to worry about &quot;losing their data&quot; because they &quot;forgot to save it.&quot; When designing your app, make sure you autoSave in these cases:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The user edits a value in one field and taps into another.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The user edits a value and then performs the Back Gesture.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The user edits a value, minimizes the app to a card and then quits the app.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There are some cases where it's better to allow the user to explicitly commit changes they've made in a scene. Here's am example. Your application requires a userid and password to login, and requires a use to reset the password every two months, it would be better to provide two buttons: one that commits the change and another that discards it. If you automatically updated the password and the user had made a typing mistake, they wouldn't be able to access their account or data again. If the potential consequences of autoSave outweigh the benefits, allow the user to save the changes themselves.
    </p>
    <h4 id="plan-for-interruptions">
      Plan for Interruptions
    </h4>
    <p>
      A user might be using your app and, all of a sudden, an important meeting notification or text message arrives and they have to deal with it. The webOS platform handles this nicely by displaying notifications below your app in the Notification Bar, but your app should be ready, too. If you're creating the kind of app where interruptions could be a problem (e.g., a game), consider building autoPause functionality into your game when a Popup Notification arrives, or when a user quickly minimizes your app to a card because their boss just popped into their office!
    </p>
    <h4 id="use-system-resources-responsibly">
      Use System Resources Responsibly
    </h4>
    <p>
      One of the coolest things about the webOS platform is that your app can be running while others are, too. When your application is being used, your app should use system resources in the best way it can. If the user (or the system) minimizes it to a card, your app should throttle back and run in a more conservative manner. What do we mean by that? Here's an example. If your app usually requires near-continuous network access while running, poll the network while your app is maximized and in use, but if your app gets minimized to a card, chill out! Either discontinue polling or seriously reduce the number of times you poll the the network. Doing so will allow the app that is maximized to make the greatest use of the system, and that's the app the user cares about the most -- the one they're using right now.

      Let's Review
    </h4>
    <p>
      The Email team did a very good job of creating a clean and simple application that accomplished their goals, and supported the user's workflow simply and elegantly. You can do it when you design your app too, and it all starts with a few great ideas and a pencil and paper -- or marker and whiteboard.
