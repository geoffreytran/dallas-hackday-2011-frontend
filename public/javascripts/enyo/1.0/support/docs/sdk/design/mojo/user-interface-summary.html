      Overview
    </h2>
    <p>
      This page summaries the supported user interface (UI) actions, guidelines for optimal scene functionality, and the building blocks for scenes.

    <h2 id="user-expectations">
      User Expectations
    </h2>
    <p>
      Users learn to operate the device by using its built-in applications. If new applications work similarly and include standard UI controls, users learn how to use them more quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to easy and intuitive operation, users expect applications to have readable text, look great, and operate quickly. You can achieve these goals with the standard UI controls and their default style settings. There are also tools available to further customize the look of the application.
    </p>
    <h2 id="supported-ui-interactions">
      Supported UI Interactions
    </h2>
    <p>
      Users interact with the HP webOS platform by using a finger tip. (A stylus does not work.) The following table lists the supported UI interactions. A &quot;tap&quot; action is a quick press on an element. A &quot;swipe&quot; action is a quick press and drag on an element.

      Consider the screen dimensions in the following tables when designing an application for a particular device. If you want the application to respond to rotation changes, set the size of the scene elements so they appear correctly after rotating the device. For more info, see Accelerometer and Canvas Tag Support.

      Screen Modes
    </h3>
    <p>
      The HP webOS platform includes the following screen modes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Default—Shows the entire image, without any cropping.
      </li>
      <li>Full-screen—Shows a portion of the source frame, but allows the application to fill the entire screen. Full-screen mode hides the Status and Notification bars. However, this mode does not stop pop-up notifications from appearing on the screen.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For more info, see <a href="/dev-guide/mojo/media-extensions.html">Media Extensions</a>, <a href="/dev-guide/mojo/all-about-widgets/pickers.html#file-picker">FilePicker</a>, and <a href="/dev-guide/mojo/video.html">Video</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="transitions">
      Transitions
    </h3>
    <p>
      Use the following transitions for consistent application operation:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cross-fade—Moving to a similar level.
      </li>
      <li>New Card—Launching another application.
      </li>
      <li>Zoom In—Moving <em>down</em> a level in the hierarchy.
      </li>
      <li>Zoom Out—Moving <em>up</em> a level in the hierarchy and moving back (gesture).
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="the-application-menu">
      The Application Menu
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Application Menu allows you to create special menus that appear in each scene. This is a very powerful concept. The Application menu is a dynamic menu that contains the following menu items by default:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Edit, which should always be the first menu command
      </li>
      <li>Preferences &amp; Accounts, if applicable for your application
      </li>
      <li>Help
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="buttons-and-menu-commands">
      Buttons and Menu Commands
    </h3>
    <p>
      For each scene, create a set of command buttons and special commands in the Application menu. Include these items when working through your navigation flow. It helps to determine how many scenes are needed, which actions are needed in each, and how and when to reuse a scene for a common purpose.
    </p>
    <h3 id="plan-for-interruptions">
      Plan for Interruptions
    </h3>
    <p>
      It is common for notifications (e.g., meeting reminder or text message) to appear while using an application. When notifications appear, the HP webOS platform displays them below the application in the notification bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interruptions can ruin the user experience of some applications, such as games. Consider including an auto-pause feature that triggers when receiving a pop-up notification or when the user minimizes the application.
    </p>
    <h3 id="errors">
      Errors
    </h3>
    <p>
      Report an error when the problem impacts the user experience and the application cannot resolve the issue quickly on its own. Consider the recommendations in the following table.
    </p>
    <table border="0">
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Topic
          </th>
          <th>
            Recommendation
          </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Banner notification
          </td>
          <td>
            Use this location when the user only needs to know about the problem, but does not need to take action.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Dialog panel
          </td>
          <td>
            Use this location when the application cannot continue without a decision by the user.<br>
            <br>
            When writing the message and naming the buttons, remember to phrase the message as concisely as possible so the user understands the issue and what actions they can take. Also, avoid the word &quot;please,&quot; negative phrases (e.g., &quot;invalid account&quot; or &quot;wrong password&quot;), and technical phrases (e.g., &quot;server error&quot; or &quot;timed out&quot;). A good example is &quot;Try again.&quot; Provide buttons that make it simple to take corrective actions. Use verbs or phrases for the button titles that correspond directly to the language used in the message. If any of the actions are destructive, use the &quot;destructive&quot; button style and provide a CANCEL button.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Inline message
          </td>
          <td>
            Use this location to show an error alert icon and a message in the scene, under the tapped item that generated the problem. If multiple items contribute to the problem (e.g., incorrect username and password), show a single message summarizing how the user can correct the problem.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h3 id="launching-new-cards">
      Launching New Cards
    </h3>
    <p>
      Sometimes a user needs to open multiple cards to collect information before continuing with an application, such as when composing an email message. Consider this situation when designing the scenes and workflow for your application. Because each card requires additional device resources, try to launch new cards only when necessary.
    </p>
    <h3 id="saving-data">
      Saving Data
    </h3>
    <p>
      We recommend that you use autoSave when the user edits:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>A value in one field and then taps into another.
      </li>
      <li>A value and then performs the back gesture.
      </li>
      <li>A value, minimizes the app to a card, and then exits the application.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="using-system-resources">
      Using System Resources
    </h3>
    <p>
      With the HP webOS platform, you can now run multiple applications. Therefore, it is important that each application uses the system resources wisely and efficiently. For example, if an application needs an almost continuous connection to the network, poll the network only when the application is maximized and in use.
