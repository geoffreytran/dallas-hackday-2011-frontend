      Planning: It's the Key
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mobile devices and the applications that run on them are typically used by very busy people, who usually have only short bursts of time in which to use your application. For this reason (and many others), it's imperative that your application design is clear, simple and helps the user succeed without ever feeling like the application is &quot;in their way.&quot; The not-so-subtle subtext of this message is that you really have to <em>think</em> about your design upfront. Here are some tips that will help you through that process.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Think about UI Design the &quot;webOS Way&quot;</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          At HP, we believe that users deserve applications that do something very specific, and do it well. Think about <em>the most important things</em> a user would do with your app, and create a simple &quot;statement of purpose&quot; that describes it. Use that statement to determine which features to include and which ones not to. Here's an example:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>We know that many people have multiple email accounts, so we designed the Email app to allow users to connect to multiple accounts, view their email from each of them, together or separately, and to read, compose, reply, and manage their email. This is actually a very tall order, but notice that Email's mission statement says nothing about managing contacts or anything else. It's an email manager, and that's all. The Email app makes use of other apps and data stores on the Pre, like Contacts. Your app should intelligently leverage other applications and their data, too.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Design an app that works like other apps users already know</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Users will learn how a Palm smartphone works by using its built-in applications. If your application works like they do and uses standard webOS UI controls, users will know how to use your app right away.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Design a beautiful app</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The emotional impact of an attractive application cannot be underestimated, and it's easy to achieve! The UI Framework provides you with:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Standard UI controls you will use in your application.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Default styling for all controls, so your app looks great from the start.
            </p>
            <p>
              Start with the default controls. If you want to customize the look of your app, you can, and we'll talk more about that later.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Design an app that is delightful to use</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Applications delight users when they enable them to get their tasks done quickly and efficiently. This is especially important for mobile users, who often only have 10 or 15 seconds to use your application. Your app will be their favorite if it helps them get something important done quickly, efficiently and easily.

      The Palm Pre smartphone's display is 320 pixels wide x 480 pixels high. You won't be able fit <strong>every screen</strong> and <strong>every feature</strong> from your website, desktop app or mobile app in your webOS app. Heed the good advice given long, long ago: &quot;<a href="http://www.accessdevnet.com/docs/zenofpalm/Enlightenment.html#971284">Don't try to fit a mountain into a teacup</a>&quot;. It was good advice then, and it still is now! When determining what to include in your product, focus on what <em>users really need</em> when they're on the go, and use your well-crafted statement of purpose to determine the features that <em>really</em> need to be in your app. We'll help you see how this process works later in the document.
    </p>
    <h3 id="we-know-what-its-like">
      We Know What It's Like
    </h3>
    <p>
      We've been in the Mobile UI business for a long time, and some of our developers have come from other backgrounds, as well (web design, desktop application design and feature phone app design). We know what it takes to design and deliver a <em>great</em> mobile application. Here are few tips to help you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Are you a website developer?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Good! Because you are already familiar with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, you're halfway down the road to success. The next step is to think about the product you want to create (or how you can use the best things from your website) and deliver those in an outstanding mobile application that will run on (and take advantage of) the webOS platform.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Are you a Desktop Application Designer?</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Even though many mobile devices have screens smaller than what you're used to designing for, we think you'll feel right at home designing a webOS application. The webOS platform has many of the same desktop UI controls you're familiar with. Your biggest challenge will be figuring out which of your desktop features users truly need when they're on-the-go, and discovering what new features you might want to add, given the great technologies that the webOS platform provides. Focus on the features that are most important to your users when they're on-the-go, deliver them in a nice, simple workflow and your customers will be thrilled.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>

              Porting an app from a <strong>Feature Phone?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              We know what that's like and we think you'll love designing apps on the webOS platform. The HP webOS development environment is much richer, and the device's screens are considerably bigger than most feature phones. This allows you to display more content and UI controls than you ever could in a feature phone UI. Think about it -- a richer UI + more content area = fewer screens to develop and manage. And you won't have to jam all of your commands in a single menu anymore.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Porting an app from a <strong>competing Mobile OS?</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
              Some mobile OS's are very sophisticated, but are also limiting in many ways. Take our advice when we say, &quot;Don't just port your workflow&quot; straight to webOS. Instead, take a moment to notice the kinds of controls that the webOS platform provides you with. We have <em>actual</em> popup menus that are displayed in the <strong>same scene</strong> you are currently in. You don't HAVE to open a different scene in order to choose something from a list or edit a value. Seriously. Take a moment and get to know the core applications on webOS, notice how they're different and better than what you're used to, and take this opportunity to simplify your application's workflow. You'll realize very quickly how much simpler your app can be, once you've updated your design for the webOS platform.
            </p>
            <p>
              We also encourage you to take a look at cross-platform development. There are many options today for developing an app once, then porting to other platforms.

      Write Your App's Statement of Purpose
    </h2>
    <p>
      It's a lot of fun to brainstorm and come up with great ideas for an application, but designing and developing a great <em>mobile</em> application requires you to whittle that huge set of ideas down into a small manageable set, consisting of the most important and most useful features. Go ahead and brainstorm -- we heartily encourage it -- and then take a good, hard look at those ideas, and determine which features <em>really</em> need to be in your webOS application. Guide your thinking by working through these questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Who is this product for?</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              What kind of person might want or need it?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              How busy are they, and where/when might they use it?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Which features really</strong> <em><strong>define</strong></em> <strong>this product?</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is it a productivity application? If so, what's the most important thing it will help someone do?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is it an information application? What kind of information will it deliver, and what's the best way to deliver it to people?
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is it an entertainment application? What's the simplest and most delightful way that entertainment can be delivered?
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Which features would make your app indispensable?</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Discard any features that prevent (or distract) you from achieving this goal
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Is your app an &quot;interactive app&quot; or does it simply &quot;provide a service?&quot;</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Most applications are interactive, and require you to create a user interface. The bulk of this document is devoted to explaining how to design a great UI.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Some applications don't really have a full UI. They simply provide users with information via notifications. We call these &quot;Dashboard&quot; applications.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you want to develop a Dashboard app, read the section on Notifications, as this will be the most helpful areas for you. Dashboard apps must have an application icon (so users can start them) and at least one visible UI element. It doesn't have to be a card. It can be as simple as a Dashboard Summary Icon and related Dashboard Item UI.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The statement of purpose is intended to help you design an outstanding UI for an interactive application, so let's look at an example. HP includes an Email application on webOS devices, and it's a very useful application. It's useful because it does what it should do, and nothing else. Here's the Email application's statement of purpose:
    </p>
    <p>
      Email enables users to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Connect to personal and corporate mail servers.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Read email from multiple accounts together or separately. Open attachments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Compose an email message and send it from any account. Include attachments.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Reply to the sender, all recipients, forward, delete and manage any email.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Notice that all of these statements focus on one thing: email, and allowing the user to interact with all of the email that they receive. It says nothing about &quot;being the application that opens the Excel or PDF files&quot; that are attached to emails, or about managing all of the Contacts that you might send email to or receive it from. The team that wrote the Email program knew that they only had to do one thing: effectively manage email, and that they could make use of the other services and applications in the webOS environment to do things like manage Contacts and open files.
    </p>
    <h2 id="think-about-the-world-of-possibilities">
      Think about the world of possibilities
    </h2>
    <p>
      The webOS platform's user interaction model is based on the idea that everything is &quot;live&quot; and can be interacted with using a very natural pointing device -- your finger. This opens up a world of possibilities, and also means that everything on the screen must be big enough to tap while sitting still, while walking, riding in a car, and so on. The <strong>point</strong> is that your UI must be designed with all of these things in mind. And, in order to keep interactions simple, any changes a user makes are made in realtime. There's no need for a SAVE button or command in any application. Keep this in mind as you design and implement your application.
