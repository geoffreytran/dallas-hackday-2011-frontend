      Usability Testing
    </h2>
    <p>
      The only way to really find out if <em>regular</em> users can use your product is to let them try it. Test your product early, and test it often. Plan time to incorporate the feedback that you get after each round of testing. When testing, keep the following things in mind:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Find &quot;regular people&quot; to try your application</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          While it's fun and rewarding to have your friends and colleagues try your app, the only real way to get real unbiased feedback is to get &quot;other people&quot; to try it. There are many ways to find them.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Write a short ad and post it on free online community services, like Craigslist. Recruit people who either have a webOS device or a competing maker's device and would like to try an app like yours. Offer some form of payment (money, gift card, or something tasty, like a half-caf double mocha latte).
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              People use mobile devices on-the-go. Have them try your app wherever they'd normally use it (or in a place like that). Here are some suggestions: At the park, on a couch, standing in a line, riding in a car/bus/train, or at a coffee shop, sipping the aforementioned half-caf double mocha latte.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Ask users to perform meaningful tasks</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Flash back to your mission statement. You know what you designed your app to do. Ask users to do those things. See if they can, quickly and easily.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let users poke around afterwards, to see what they'd do with your app on their own.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Watch and listen closely</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Watch users while they work.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Let users struggle a little while they work. See if they can figure out what to do without your help.
            </p>
            <p>
              If they struggle for &quot;too long&quot; or are getting frustrated, ask them what they're trying to do.
            </p>
            <p>
              Use that opportunity to find out what was difficult for them.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Look for trends</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Record the problems that you discover in each test.
            </p>
            <p>
              If many users experience the same problems, there's probably a problem with the UI design or the implementation.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If only one or two people have problems, try to find out why. Ask them questions while meeting with them.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create solutions</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Usability Testing helps you find the &quot;biggest obstacles&quot; in your UI. Brainstorming afterwards helps you come up with great ways to fix them, using standard UI controls and interactions wherever possible.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Feel free to brainstorm with users after a usability study, but remember that you don't have to do everything each one of them says. Take their suggestions as input, consider it and go with the ideas that make sense, and are consistent with the way other apps on the webOS platform work.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Fix the problems and test the app again.</strong>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Once your application has been developed, user tested and unit-tested for quality, you're ready to go. Here are the last few items you need to attend to before uploading your application to the Palm App Catalog.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Create your application icon</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              64 by 64 pixel PNG file, with a 56 x 56 pixel image centered within the frame
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              48 by 48 pixel PNG file, with a 42 x 42 pixel image centered within the frame
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              24 bit/pixel RGB with a 1-bit alpha channel
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Do not render a &quot;glossy shine&quot; like applications on other mobile OS platforms. Instead, place your application image on a rectangular base (like Music or Videos apps) or use a photo-realistic image with a transparent circle behind it (like Web, Camera or Photos).
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Make sure it's ready</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Check your app using the Application Checklist.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              If you can check all of the items on the list, you're ready to submit it!
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Submit it</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Upload your app to the App Catalog.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Write a description.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Tag it with keyword descriptors, so users can find it when they search.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              Add Screenshots.
            </p>
            <p>
              Press Orange+Sym+P. The screen capture will be in the Screen Captures folder when you mount your device to your computer as a USB drive.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Every webOS device ships with the App Catalog application, which users will use to find your app. So get to work and create a truly amazingly great application! The world is waiting.
