      Sketch the Workflow

    <p>
      The first thing you should do when designing a mobile application is to &quot;work out the workflow,&quot; so put that mouse down and grab a pencil and piece of paper, or grab a dry-erase marker and start drawing on a whiteboard. Draw simple boxes that represent each screen (or scene, as we call them) in your design. Connect them with arrows, so you know what will happen when the user taps an item on the screen and then take a step back and <em>really</em> examine what you designed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have you created a workflow that helps the user accomplish the most important things they'll do with your app, using the fewest steps? Remember that they may only have 15 seconds at a time to use your application. That's a humbling thought, isn't it? Make sure the workflow's smooth and efficient. Let's take a look at the Email app as an example.
    </p>
    <p>

      <br>
      Email's workflow accomplishes the user's primary goals, which are to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Read emails quickly
      </li>
      <li>Create email messages quickly
      </li>
      <li>Reply/forward emails quickly
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These are actually <strong>performance goals</strong>, which nicely complement the Email product's mission statement. Performance goals keep you honest, and help you focus on efficiency. When designing your application, think about the tasks that users need to do <strong>most often</strong>, and design your workflow so your users can do those things quickly and efficiently.

      Basic Elements

    <p>
      In HP webOS applications, we call each step in the workflow a &quot;scene&quot;. A scene is analogous to a window or dialog box in a desktop application, or a page in a website design. A scene commonly contains the following elements:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Header</strong> (Optional)
        </p>
        <p>
          Displays a Fixed or Scrolling header, which is used to display the title of the scene, and any other controls that affect the view. There are two kinds:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              A Fixed Header remains in place, even when the user scrolls content underneath it. Fixed headers are 50 px tall.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              A Scrolling Header scrolls out of view when the user scrolls content underneath it. Its height can vary. The example below shows a scrolling header that is 68 px tall.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Scroll View</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          The area that displays the UI Controls or information needed in the scene.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Similar to content in a web page or web application.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              The user can scroll content in this area up and down freely.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Command Menu</strong> (Optional)
        </p>
        <p>
          Displays Command Buttons, which are used to perform the <strong>most important actions</strong> in the scene.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Buttons appear at the bottom of the scene, in the Command Menu area.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              They float above the content in the Scroll View, when the user scrolls it. This means the buttons will always be visible.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Application Menu commands</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Appears in the upper left hand corner of the display, in the Status Bar.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              Is used to display commands for the &quot;other actions&quot; a user may need to perform in a scene.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              You can insert new commands in the App Menu in each scene.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

      Scene Dimensions
    </h3>
    <p>
      Each webOS device has a specific screen size, and certain OS-based elements will occupy a fixed amount of space on that screen. Many developers ask &quot;How much space will I have to design with in a scene&quot; and the answer is &quot;It depends.&quot; To answer the question, you need to know which items the OS will display, and how tall each area is. There are also elements that are commonly included in scenes that require a fixed amount of space. Let's use the Palm Pre as an example. Its screen is 320 pixels wide by 480 pixels high (portrait mode) and 480 x 320 (landscape mode).
    </p>
    <h4 id="os-controlled-areas">
      OS-Controlled Areas
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>Status Bar</strong> appears at the top of the screen and is <strong>28</strong> pixels high. It contains the Application Menu, the Time and the Connection menu. It occupies 28 pixels of height and is always displayed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          The <strong>Notification Bar</strong> appears at the bottom of the screen when a background application posts a notification. When it appears, it pushes the bottom of your application upward by <strong>28</strong> pixels.
        </p>
        <p>
          Apps like Email or Messaging display banner notifications and dashboard summary icons in this area regularly. It's a good idea to &quot;plan&quot; that something will appear in this space when you're designing your app.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          <strong>Popup Notifications</strong> can also appear, and they vary in height. They can be as large as half the screen height, depending on what they're informing the user about.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users typically see a popup notification and interact with it immediately, and it either disappears completely, or minimizes to the Notification Bar, occupying only 28 pixels of height.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not necessary to worry about the height of Popup Notifications when designing your scene. They overlay your scene for a moment, and disappear quickly.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4 id="common-scene-elements">
      Common Scene Elements
    </h4>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Scenes commonly contain a Fixed Header or a Scrolling Header, to serve as a title and contain other controls (if needed).
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Scrolling Headers</strong> can be almost any height. We <strong>suggest</strong> <strong>50</strong> pixels, but you can set them to be <strong>any size</strong>. Scrolling headers scroll out of view when a user scrolls the scene.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>Fixed Headers</strong> stay in one location, and have a fixed height (<strong>50</strong> pixels). They float above content from the scene when the user scrolls up and down.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <strong>View Menus</strong> consist of a Fixed Header and a popup menu that can be used to control what is displayed in the scene below. They are 50 pixels tall and float above the scene, as well.
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Scenes commonly contain <strong>Command Buttons</strong> in the Command Menu Area. This area is <strong>50</strong> pixels high and can contain up to 5 items. They float above content from the scene when the user scrolls up and down.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      As you can see, the answer to the question &quot;how much space do I have in a scene&quot; is not a simple one. It really depends on the screen size, what the OS displays, and what you have chosen to include in your scene. Here's an example to see how it would work on a scene on the Palm Pre. If a scene included a fixed header (<strong>50</strong> pixels) and we wanted to account for the appearance of notifications (<strong>28</strong> pixels) plus the always-present Status Bar (<strong>28</strong> pixels), we have to assume that <strong>106</strong> pixels would be taken up by these things. On the Palm Pre, we'll be able to display the following amount of content in a scene: <strong>320 wide x 374 high</strong> in Portrait mode and <strong>480 wide x 214 high</strong> in Landscape mode (if the app supports rotation).

    <p>
      We understand that some application designers and developers want to create a &quot;clean, immersive experience, free of any unnecessary OS clutter.&quot; This is common desire among people who develop Games and Media applications. The webOS platform allows developers to run their app in &quot;Full Screen Mode&quot; for such occasions. This allows the application to take over the entire screen, hiding the Status and Notification Bars. The only notifications that are NOT suppressed are popup Notifications, which is a good thing. The OS allows those notifications to come through so the user won't miss an important phone call or meeting reminder.
