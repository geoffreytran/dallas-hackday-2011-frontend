      Developing Mojo Applications
    </h1>
    <p>
      A webOS Mojo application is composed of one or more distinct <a href="/dev-guide/mojo/basics-scenes.html">scenes</a>, rendered on a <a href="/dev-guide/mojo/basics-stages.html">stage</a>. The stage roughly corresponds to an application's card, and each scene provides the content for the card. Think of the stage as a window or tab in a browser, and each scene as a different web page, and you'll get the idea. Each scene has underlying Javascript code that provides the behavior of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Within a scene, the application presents <a href="/reference/mojo/widgets.html">Widgets</a>, or controls, to the user. When the user interacts with a widget (or performs a gesture), an <a href="/dev-guide/mojo/events.html">event</a> is generated. By listening for events, your application can respond to user input. If you have developed user interface code in JavaScript, widgets and events will already be familiar to you.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, the scene and its elements conform to the <a href="http://www.w3.org/DOM/">W3C DOM</a> (Document Object Model), an interface that provides access to all elements on a web page so that the content can by dynamically updated or manipulated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The webOS Mojo Framework includes a <a href="/reference/services.html">Services API</a> that provides access to system and hardware capabilities. Using services, your application can send and receive messages from a remote server, communicate with other applications on the device, set alarms and calendar events, play media files, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your application can store and retrieve data using the HTML5 database interface, or using the Cookie and Depot objects provided by the framework.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following sections provide additional detail about the application structure.
    </p>
    <h2 id="a-tour-of-the-application-directory">
      A Tour of the Application Directory
    </h2>
    <p>
      The HTML, Javascript, CSS and image files that make up the application are stored in a specific directory structure that the framework relies on when it runs the application. This tour shows the files and directories that might exist in a simple application.

      Basic Concepts
    </h2>
    <h3 id="stages-and-scenes">
      Stages and Scenes
    </h3>
    <p>
      The simplest applications have a single stage (a single card) and a few scenes. The Calendar application is a good example. The main scene (the main view) shows the current day, week, or month. Actions by the user cause different scenes to be pushed onto the stage by the application. For example, selecting Prefs &amp; Accounts pushes the Preferences and Accounts scene. Subsequently choosing Add an Account pushes the Choose Account Type scene. The result is a stack of scenes on the stage -- called, appropriately enough, the <strong>scene stack</strong>. Each scene pops itself off the stack when its task is completed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <img src="/images/palm/CalendarSceneHierarchy.png"><br>
    </p>
    <h4 id="assistants-and-controllers">
      Assistants and Controllers
    </h4>
    <p>
      Each scene has an <strong>assistant</strong>, JavaScript code that provides the scene's behavior and capabilities. The stage also has an assistant, and the application can have an assistant as well. The assistants differ somewhat in their roles:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          application assistant -- sets up non-standard stages. The application assistant is usually only present in applications that have multiple stages, or background applications that have no stages at all.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          stage assistant -- sets up any application-wide objects, and pushes the first scene.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          scene assistant -- provides the scene's behavior, including handling events, displaying data, pushing the next scene, and popping itself off the stack when necessary.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Each assistant has an instance of its own type of <strong>controller</strong>:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          application controller — creates the application assistant, and provides functions for creating and managing stages. Every application has an application controller, regardless of whether it has an application assistant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          stage controller — provides functions for creating and managing scenes. Every application has a stage controller for each stage, for access by the corresponding stage assistant.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          scene controller — provides functions for managing objects and elements within a scene. Each scene has a scene controller. The stage controller has access to the stack of scene controllers.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3 id="events">
      Events
    </h3>
    <p>
      The Mojo framework defines event types that support the hardware, gestures, application launch, widgets, and so on. Applications can define their own event types (for special widgets, for example) and broadcast them. Events propagate to any code that is subscribed as a listener.
    </p>
    <p>
      For more information about events, see <a href="/dev-guide/mojo/events.html">Events</a>.
    </p>
    <h3 id="application-launch-cycle">
      Application Launch Cycle
    </h3>
    <p>
      A webOS application is launched by the user from the Launcher, or by another application. Most webOS applications present a single card, and are intended to run mainly in the foreground -- that is, they are there to use the screen for interaction with the user. The user can put a foreground application in the background by minimizing the card, and can bring a card back to the foreground by maximizing the card to fill the screen. Some applications are designed to run only in the background, and do not present a card at all. These background applications interact with the user mainly by displaying alerts and notifications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is a simple launch cycle example, a foreground application with two scenes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The application is launched.
        <ul>
          <li>The application assistant (if present) becomes active.
            <ul>
              <li>The stage assistant becomes active and pushes the first scene.
                <ul>
                  <li>The first scene is active, receiving events and updating its display.
                  </li>
                  <li>The first scene assistant pushes the second scene (in response to an event).
                    <ul>
                      <li>The second scene is active, receiving events and updating its display.
                      </li>
                      <li>The second scene is popped (in response to an event).
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>The first scene is active again.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>The first scene is popped (in response to an event).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The application is closed (in response to an event).
      </li>
    </ul>
